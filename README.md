This project serves as a base to start creating a slackbot.

The tools used include:

- node
- npm
- [botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit)

What my botkit does..

1. Listens for any ambient mention of the word "what" and returns a hilarios meme.
2. Listens for any mention of the word "robot" or "human" and returns a list of users that are either bots or humans
