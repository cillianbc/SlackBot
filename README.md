# My First Slackbot

This project serves as a base to start creating a slackbot.

The tools used include:

- node
- npm
- [botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit)
- [now.sh](https://now.sh)

What my botkit does..

1. Listens for any ambient mention of the word "what" and returns a hilarius meme.
2. Listens for any mention of the word "robot" or "human" and returns a list of users that are either bots or humans


Next Steps.

1. Reply with a direct message to user if they ask when class is on next.
2. Reply with message to question about what the user will need to wear to class( Based on weather for class on that date )
